# Chatty App Project

A Slack clone by Lighthouse Labs for web bootcamp students to learn front-end dev skillz, now completed by Curtis Bateson.

This Slack clone allows you to join the Chatty and send messages that can be viewed by other users that are also connected. You'll be able to message anonymously or set your username and the colour on your username is picked for you when you connect. You'll be notified when a new user joins the Chatty and the total number of connected users is always displayed in the top right.

The Chatty Client can be found at: https://github.com/curtisbateson/chatty
